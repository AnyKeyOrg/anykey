  verifications:
    faq:
      question-1: "1. Who is AnyKey’s identity verification system for?"
      answer-1: "Our verification system certifies that <em>you are who you say you are</em> with respect to your gender identity, so you can demonstrate your eligibility for marginalized gender esports events. Once we verify your eligibility, we will email you an eligibility certificate that can be used to register for events that are for marginalized genders."
      question-2: "2. What counts as a “marginalized gender”?"
      answer-2: "In gaming and esports, players who are marginalized because of their gender include women, non-binary, and/or trans folks.<br><br>At AnyKey, we define non-binary as a vast umbrella which includes folks who are: agender, bigender, demigender, intersex, gender non-conforming, genderfluid, genderqueer, pangender, two-spirit, or xenogender—regardless of their assigned gender at birth."
      question-3: "3. How does this eligibility certification process work?"
      answer-3: "Players who want to have their eligibility for marginalized gender events certified fill out the verification form with evidence of a public track record of their identity.<br><br>All applicants must submit physical photo identification alongside a handwritten note with their player ID and the current date. If their photo ID does not have an affirming gender or sex marker, to prove that <em>they are who they say they are</em> competitors can choose to also submit an official doctor’s note or a well-established social media account with a 2+ year history containing identity-related content. Players who cannot or do not want to provide these forms of documentation can request verification via voice chat.<br><br>Trained ComfyCrew moderators review each request to verify the details. Players who submit sufficient proof of their marginalized gender identity will receive an email that contains their unique AnyKey Eligibility Certificate. Players can use this certificate to register for tournaments that require proof of eligibility."
      question-4: "4. How does AnyKey decide whether or not to certify someone?"
      answer-4: "AnyKey’s team needs to see a track record demonstrating that the applicant <em>is who they say they are</em> outside of the gaming space. This identity story might be told through official documentation, social media history, or during a voice chat interview.<br><br>If our ComfyCrew moderators do not receive enough evidence to give them sufficient confidence in applicant’s gender identity story, their request for certification will not be approved."
      question-5: "5. What forms of photo ID are acceptable?"
      answer-5: "We accept any physical identification document from an official organization if it has your photo and full name. Examples include: identity card, driver's license, passport, tribal membership, library card, employee badge, student or military ID.<br><br>Photo IDs must be photographed or scanned next to a handwritten note with the applicant’s player ID and current date."
      question-6: "6. What if I my preferred name is not on my official document?"
      answer-6: "The full name on your application should match the preferred name you use to register for tournament competition. If your preferred name differs from the one on your photo ID or doctor’s note, please provide a short explanation in the Additional Notes section."
      question-7: "7. What qualifies as a “well-established social media account”?"
      answer-7: "Verifying with social media requires a publicly viewable profile created 2+ years ago and a direct link to a post made at least one year prior that clearly references the applicant’s gender identity.<br><br>Direct links should be included in the Additional Notes section of the application. Discord comments are acceptable if they are still viewable on a public server and a server invite is also provided.<br><br>Neither profile pics nor pronouns in bio qualify as proof of gender identity. Screenshots of past comments and posts on private social media accounts will not be accepted."
      question-8: "8. What if I want to provide more than one social media account?"
      answer-8: "Use the Additional Notes section of the verification form to share supplemental social media accounts or other relevant information."
      question-9: "9. How does voice chat verification work?"
      answer-9: "Players who request voice chat verification will receive an email invitation to the #verification-lounge in AnyKey’s Discord server. Once there, applicants will find instructions about setting up their interview with one of our ComfyCrew moderators.<br><br>During the voice chat interview, players are invited to tell us about themselves, why marginalized gender tournaments matter to them personally, and to answer questions about their gender identity outside of gaming. Our process is designed to create an affirming and supportive experience for anyone sharing their authentic story."
      question-10: "10. Why do I need to link my Player ID and Discord account?"
      answer-10: "Applicants are requested to link their Player IDs to their Discord account to facilitate certification and expediate crosscheck with tournament organizers requiring verification of this connection."
      question-11: "11. What if I am not publicly out about my gender?"
      answer-11: "You can request voice chat verification if you are not publicly open about your gender identity. During the interview, our ComfyCrew moderators will ask you to discuss your authentic story in private to give them confidence that <em>you are who you say you are</em>.<br><br>But remember: events for players of marginalized gender highlight and amplify underrepresented gamers! If you and your team play well, you could advance to a championship event where you would be highly visible playing on stage and stream. Before registering for such events, be sure you’re ready to be out in that arena."
      question-12: "12. How do you keep my sensitive data secure?"
      answer-12: "Our encrypted system ensures that only ComfyCrew moderators can access your information. Any documents you upload, such as a photo ID or doctor’s note, will automatically be deleted from our file server after your application is reviewed.<br><br>You are welcome to redact sensitive details from your documents if they aren’t directly relevant to the identity verification process. For instance, you may blur out your address as an extra safety measure."
      question-13: "13. Why wasn't my application approved?"
      answer-13: "If your request does not include necessary information, or if your uploaded documents lack required details, you will receive an email notification that your application was not approved. It will contain directions for reapplying with supplemental information or a recommendation to request voice chat verification.<br><br>Not being approved just signals we need more information; it very rarely means an applicant has misrepresented themself."
      question-14: "14. How long does it take to verify my eligibility?"
      answer-14: "Most applications are reviewed within 48 hours, but some may take up to one week to be evaluated. Photo IDs and doctor’s notes are processed quickly, but players who submit social media or request voice chat verification should expect to wait longer than average.<br><br>Even if you aren’t sure if you will make a team roster, you should apply well in advance of event registrations to be prepared."
      question-15: "15. What do I do with my eligibility certificate?"
      answer-15: "If your application is approved, you will receive an email with an AnyKey Eligibility Certificate that shows your full name, date of birth, email, player ID, gender, and pronouns. It will also include a unique code and be stamped with the date of issue.<br><br>You can use this certificate to prove your eligibility when you register for marginalized gender events. Tournament organizers or showrunners will ask for a screenshot of your certificate and they may also require you enter your unique certificate code separately. Once verified, your certificate is valid for a year of competition."
      question-16: "16. Does my eligibility certificate expire?"
      answer-16: "Yes, your eligibility certificate expires one year from the issue date. You can renew it by reapplying one month before, or any time after, the expiration. Be sure to include the unique code from your previous certificate so that we can expedite your request."
      question-17: "17. What if I need to change details on my eligibility certificate?"
      answer-17: "Players who substantially change their name, gender, email, or Player ID should reapply for a new eligibility certificate. Changing Discord username or social media handle does not affect eligibility.<br><br>To request an updated certificate, submit a new application and use the Additional Notes to indicate you are reapplying with different personal details. Be sure to include the unique code from your previous certificate so that we can expedite your request."
      question-18: "18. Who decides if I can participate in an event?"
      answer-18: "Tournament owners and organizers determine eligibility criteria and decide who can participate in their events. AnyKey certifies that <em>you are who you say you are</em> with respect to your marginalized gender identity, but each organization defines their own rules for eligibility, so you should be sure to check competition details."
      question-19: "19. Can trans men get certified?"
      answer-19: "Of course, trans men are marginalized because of their gender too! AnyKey certifies all transmasculine applicants who show a track record of their identity story. Unfortunately not all marginalized gender tournaments allow trans men to participate, so be sure to check event rules for their eligibility requirements."
      question-20: "20. What happens if a player is accused of faking their identity?"
      answer-20: "If AnyKey loses confidence a player <em>is who they say they are</em>, we may withdraw their eligibility certificate. Tournament organizers and showrunners may pursue punitive action if they find a player has violated event eligibility rules by misrepresenting themselves.<br><br>If you have concerns about a fellow competitor in a marginalized gender event requiring AnyKey eligibility certification, please notify our ComfyCrew moderators by clicking the Share Concern button below. We log all details submitted in these reports and take action to withdraw certificates in cases when there is significant evidence to cast doubt on the player’s gender identity story."
      question-21: "21. Why are there esports events for marginalized genders?"
      answer-21: "There are many cultural barriers that cause women, non-binary, and/or trans players to be harassed, discriminated against, and excluded from gaming spaces. Marginalized gender events support these players by providing opportunities to gain crucial competitive experience and build a supportive community network. These events also elevate and amplify the top players toward main event opportunities, media visibility, and potential sponsorships."
      question-22: "22. Where do I go if I have more questions?"
      answer-22: "Feel free to join us in our Discord server to ask any questions you have about AnyKey, the ComfyCrew, our eligibility certification process, or the concept of gender itself! We’re always happy to chat about complex topics with fellow gamers."
