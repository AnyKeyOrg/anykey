  verifications:
    faq:
      question-1: "Who is AnyKey’s identity verification system for?"
      answer-1: "Our verification system certifies that <em>you are who you say you are</em> with respect to your gender identity, so you can demonstrate your eligibility for marginalized gender esports events. Once we verify your eligibility, we will email you an eligibility certificate that can be used to register for events that are for marginalized genders."
      question-2: "What counts as a “marginalized gender”?"
      answer-2: "In gaming and esports, players who are marginalized because of their gender include women, non-binary, and/or trans folks.<br><br>At AnyKey, we define non-binary as a vast umbrella which includes folks who are: agender, bigender, demigender, intersex, gender non-conforming, genderfluid, genderqueer, pangender, two-spirit, or xenogender—regardless of their assigned gender at birth."
      question-3: "How does this eligibility certification process work?"
      answer-3: "Players who want to have their eligibility for marginalized gender events certified fill out the verification form with evidence of a public track record of their identity.<br><br>Applicants can choose to provide one of several options to prove that <em>they are who they say they are</em>: a photo ID with gender or sex marker, an affirming doctor’s note, or a well-established social media account with a history of identity-related content. Players who cannot or do not want to provide any of these forms of documentation can request verification via voice chat.<br><br>Trained ComfyCrew moderators review each request to verify the details. Players who submit sufficient proof of their marginalized gender identity will receive an email that contains their unique AnyKey Eligibility Certificate. Players can use this certificate to register for tournaments that require proof of eligibility."
      question-4: "How does voice chat verification work?"
      answer-4: "Players who request voice chat verification will receive an email invitation to the #verification-lounge in AnyKey’s Discord server. Once there, applicants will find instructions about setting up their interview with one of our ComfyCrew moderators.<br><br>During the voice chat interview, players are invited to tell us about themselves, why marginalized gender tournaments matter to them personally, and to answer questions about their gender identity. Our process is designed to create an affirming and supportive experience for anyone presenting themselves authentically."
      question-5: "How does AnyKey decide whether or not to verify someone?"
      answer-5: "AnyKey’s team wants to see a track record that shows a player genuinely <em>is who they say they are</em> outside of the gaming space. This identity story might be told through official documentation, social media history, or during a voice chat interview."
      question-6: "What qualifies as a “well-established social media account”?"
      answer-6: "Any public social media account with 6+ months of activity that includes references to or discussion of the applicant’s gender identity. Not every post has to be about gender, follower count is not important, but we need to see more than just pronouns in bio.<br><br>Private social media accounts will not be considered. Request voice chat or provide other documentation if all your socials are private."
      question-7: "What if I want to provide more than one social media account?"
      answer-7: "Use the “Additional Notes” section of the verification form to share supplemental social media accounts or other relevant information."
      question-8: "What if I am not publicly out about my gender?"
      answer-8: "You can request a voice chat verification interview if you are not publicly open about your gender identity.<br><br>But remember: events for players of marginalized gender highlight and amplify underrepresented gamers! If you and your team play well, you could advance to a championship event where you would be highly visible playing on stage and stream. Before registering for such events, be sure you’re ready to be out in that arena."
      question-9: "How do you keep my sensitive data secure?"
      answer-9: "Our encrypted system ensures that only ComfyCrew moderators can access your information. Any documents you upload, such as a photo ID or doctor’s note, will automatically be deleted from our file server after your application is reviewed.<br><br>You are welcome to redact sensitive details from your documents if they aren't directly relevant to the identity verification process. For instance, you may blur out your address as an extra safety measure."
      question-10: "How long does it take to verify my eligibility?"
      answer-10: "Most applications are reviewed within 48 hours, but some may take up to one week to be evaluated. Players who request voice chat verification should expect to wait longer than average because of the extra time an involved in the interview process."
      question-11: "What do I do with my eligibility certificate?"
      answer-11: "If your application is approved, you will receive an email with an AnyKey Eligibility Certificate that shows your full name, email, Discord username, player ID, gender, and pronouns. It will also include a unique code and be stamped with the date of issue.<br><br>You can use this certificate to prove your eligibility when you register for a marginalized gender event. Tournament organizers or showrunners will ask for a screenshot of your certificate and they may also require you enter your unique certificate code separately."
      question-12: "What if I need to change the details on my eligibility certificate?"
      answer-12: "If the main alias of your player ID or Discord username is still recognizable (e.g. you change your clan tag but keep your main handle) then most tournament organizers will still accept your eligibility certificate. But if your personal information morphs in a big way (e.g. name change, new handle, gender transition), then you should submit a new application with those updated details."
      question-13: "Who decides if I can participate in an event?"
      answer-13: "Tournament owners and organizers determine eligibility criteria and decide who can participate in their events. AnyKey certifies that <em>you are who you say you are</em> with respect to your marginalized gender identity, but each organization defines their own rules for eligibility, so you should be sure to check competition details."
      question-14: "Can trans men get certified?"
      answer-14: "Of course, trans men are marginalized because of their gender too! AnyKey certifies all transmasculine applicants who show a track record of their identity story. However, unfortunately not all marginalized gender tournaments allow trans men to participate, so be sure to check event rules for their eligibility requirements."
      question-15: "What happens if a player is accused of faking their identity?"
      answer-15: "Tournament organizers or showrunners are responsible for investigating allegations that a player may have violated their event eligibility rules or is otherwise <em>not who they say they are</em>.<br><br>AnyKey may authenticate a contested player's certificate or provide background on the verification decision, but final rulings are decided by competition organizers or league owners."
      question-16: "Why are there esports events for marginalized genders anyway?"
      answer-16: "There are many cultural barriers that cause women, non-binary, and/or trans players to be harassed, discriminated against, and excluded from gaming spaces. Marginalized gender events support these players by providing opportunities to gain crucial competitive experience and build a supportive community network. These events also elevate and amplify the top players toward main event opportunities, media visibility, and potential sponsorships."
      question-17: "Where do I go if I have more questions?"
      answer-17: "Feel free to join us in our Discord server to ask any questions you have about AnyKey, the ComfyCrew, our eligibility certification process, or the concept of gender itself! We’re always happy to chat about complex topics with fellow gamers."
