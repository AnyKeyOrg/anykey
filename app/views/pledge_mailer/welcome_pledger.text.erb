Hey <%= @pledge.first_name %>,

Thank you for taking the GLHF pledge!

We're excited that you're ready to help make your online gaming spaces more inclusive for everyone. So you don't forget, we're sending you a reminder that you've made a promise to...

1. Be a good sport whether I win or lose
2. Know that people online are real people and my words have real impact
3. Set a positive example with my behavior
4. Speak up against discrimination, hate speech, harassment, and abuse
5. Show integrity by honoring the rules, my opponents, and my teammates
6. Stop, listen, and reassess if Iâ€™m told that my words or actions are harmful
7. Respect others, even if their sincere opinions are different from my own

You have agreed to play by these seven rules and to hold other pledge-takers to the same standard. That means you will stand up, speak out, and report when you see harassment and discrimination happening in your communities. So if you see someone sporting the badge causing trouble in a stream, please file a report so that our moderation team can review the situation.

Good Luck, Have Fun!
