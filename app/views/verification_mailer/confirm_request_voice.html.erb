Hey <%= @verification.first_name %>,
<br><br>
We received your request that you want to verify your eligibility via voice chat. 
<br><br>
Please join our <%= link_to("Discord server", "https://discord.gg/Vpn8QQzTtS") %> and visit the #verification-lounge where you will find pinned instructions about setting up a time to speak with a member of our ComfyCrew.
<br><br>
During the voice chat interview, you will be invited to tell us about yourself, why marginalized gender tournaments matter to you personally, and to answer questions about your gender identity. Our voice verification process should be affirming and supportive if you are presenting yourself authentically!
